# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. In addition, this is for assignment one. 

I am a senior, studying Business Analytics and Political Science. I have little expereince with git hub or the git infrastructure. I've only really used GitHub to download a couple of add ons for some games I played in the past.
